What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuring, managing, and automating IT infrastructure. It allows you to perform tasks like software installation, server configuration, and cloud infrastructure management in a simple and efficient way. Ansible operates agentless, meaning that no software needs to be installed on the managed hostsâ€”only SSH access is required.
What are Playbooks used for?

Playbooks are the heart of Ansible and provide a declarative way to define tasks and configurations. They consist of a series of instructions (also known as "tasks") that are executed on specific hosts or groups of hosts. Playbooks are written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language), a user-friendly and easy-to-understand language.

With playbooks, various tasks can be automated, such as:

    Software installation and updates
    System configurations and deployment
    Cloud service automation
    Network infrastructure management

Playbooks allow for clear and repeatable execution of tasks, which can be performed on both local and remote hosts.
